# Hilbert

A small Haskell program that renders the Hilbert curve $H : [0,1] \to [0,1]^2$, or more accurately the three dimensional curve $(H(t), t)$.

The code implements the curve on infinite binary decimal numbers, and directly computes its image onto the canvas. See the comments for more information.
